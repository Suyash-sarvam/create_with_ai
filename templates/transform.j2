**Task**
Your task is to transform the provided input into a detailed, production-ready AI agent specification document. Think deeply about the business context, customer interactions, and all possible edge cases to create a comprehensive document that follows this exact format:

## Overview & Purpose
- **Bot Identity**: [Indian name and key personality traits]
- **Primary Goal**: [Primary goal of the bot]
- **Type of the call**: [Type of goal inbound or outbound]

## Objectives & Use Cases
- **Main Objective**: [Main objective bot is trying to achieve ]
- **Key Scenarios**: [Thoroughly analyze possible user journeys and identify critical scenarios]
**Instructions for writing key scenerios**
        - Think about core business objective cmplete flow with multiple subpaths.
        - Think about exception handling how the bot manages objections, refusals and edge cases.
        - Reason out and think if follow up and scheduling is required. 
        - Reason out if human escalation is required or not. 
        - Think if call closure if required in the given scenerion or not. 
        - Return the key scenario as **Scenario_name: One line descirption of the key scenario'.

## Key functionalities of the bot
    ##Greething and intro:
        [generate one line how the bot will introduce itself to the user]
        **Note**
            - Always end the introduction with the question. 
                Example of good intro_message: Hello i am Arjun from {{company_name}} am I talking to {{user_name}} ?
                Example of bad intor_messages: Hello, this is Arjun/Akhila calling on behalf of .
            - Introduction can be different based on inbound and outbound calls think accordingly and write the introduction. 

    [Create a comprehensive 10-15 sentence paragraph describing all functionality, including]:
    **Instruction for writing core functionalities for the bot**
        - Core business flow with multiple decision paths
        - Exception handling for every foreseeable situation
        - Escalation protocols with specific triggers
        - Data validation approaches
        - Confirmation and summary techniques
        - Follow-up processes
        - Integration with other systems
        - Handling of specific customer emotions (frustration, confusion, satisfaction)

## Tone & Style
- **Tone**: [Brief personality description with 1-2 examples]
- **Response Guidelines**: [Some response constraints the user that should be applied to bot example: "responses should not be more than two sentences..etc"]

user input can be minial like one line input or can be through like a paragraph, incorporate all details from the user input, but extensively expand with logical inferences about the business domain. If the input is minimal, create a rich, detailed specification by considering all possible scenarios this bot might encounter.

**Note**
- **do not** start with lines like ""I'll create a comprehensive AI agent specification for an EMI collection reminder bot." etc just start with '##Overview and purpose'. 
- **do not** end the response with lines like 'here is comprehensive ai not specification'.. etc always end the response in the above specifed document contraints.
USER INPUT:
